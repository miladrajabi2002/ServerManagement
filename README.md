## Understanding Results 📚

### IP Reputation Score:
- **80-100%**: Clean IP ✅
- **60-79%**: Moderate issues ⚠️
- **0-59%**: Dirty IP or blacklisted ❌

### Security Status:
- **PASS**: Everything is good ✅
- **WARN**: Needs attention ⚠️
- **FAIL**: Critical security issue ❌

### MTU Values:
- Default MTU is usually 1500
- Optimal MTU improves network performance
- Script automatically detects best value

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Script won't run:
```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/server
sudo server
```

### Dependencies not installing:
```bash

sudo yum install -y curl wget jq bc net-tools bind-utils traceroute
```

### Permission denied:
Always use `sudo`:
```bash
sudo server
```
